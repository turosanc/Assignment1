LEARNING SUMMARY

Merge - combines separate branches with overlapping functions

Rebase - rewrites where the branches came from, sorta like merge\
except the there is a direct pointer to the new base.

Squash - cleans up commits in a branch, makes reads logs easier. \
feature1 had an issue with bad commit messages, squash is useful \
in this case to make comments clearer

cherry-pick - Like the name implies, it only commits certain parts \
of a branch 

Git history for features - The difference observed between the features \
was the progressive degradation of commit messages. Feature1 did not \
provide any insightful commit messages. Less code changes were seen \
between feature1 - feature3
